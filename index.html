						CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979,
						an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
						with a new son and a year’s appointment at
						Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
						equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
					</p>
					<p>
						He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
						particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
						discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
						A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
						have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
						repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
						of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
					</p>
					<p>
						If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
						heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
						warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
						wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
						would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
					</p>
					<p>
						“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of
						the page and drew a double box around it.
					</p>
					<p>
						On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
						reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that
						his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
					</p>
					<p>
						Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first
							sliver of cosmic
							time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led
						by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
						Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-
						called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a
						universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a
						trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are
						the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
						and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
						many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
					</p>
					<p>
						If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
						comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe
						apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
						and space and energy to science and speculation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
						extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds
						of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
						cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover,
						beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
						other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta
						water boiling over.

					<h2><strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong></h2>
					<p>
						In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
						operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators
						on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s
						ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
						waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
						should ruffle space-time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
						expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big
						as it gets.”
					</p>
					<p>
						He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
						sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
					</p>
					<p>
						The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
						bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
						picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
						as the surface of the sun.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known
						as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
						Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing
						at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of
						papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

						<h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
						<p>
							Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
							which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly
							in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.
						</p>
						<div class="graphic-story">

									<strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion
									years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we
									can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion
									light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look,
									the universe has an even temperature.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not
									old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance
									from one side of the universe to the other, and there
									has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot
									and cold to mix into an even temperature.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale,
									imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one
									direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount
									of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much
									it has cooled.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong> Now turn around and
									look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar
									coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence?
									Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction,
									you might want to look for another explanation.
								</p>
							</div>
							<!-- CLEAR FLOAT HERE -->
							<div class="text-cards last-row">
								<p>
									<strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not
									been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to
									place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups
									were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at
									the same time, that might explain their even temperature.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The
									theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second
									after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the
									speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding
									energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures
									of the universe.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>FLUCTUATION</strong> Astronomers have now detected
									evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of
									polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which
									is energy left over from the early universe. These are
									gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee,
									imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than
									light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands.
									hat is something like inflation. And the structure of the
									universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

						Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only
						one in 10 million.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had
						not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
					</p>
					<p>
						“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have
						been lucky.”
					</p>
					<p>
						The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’
						worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a
						leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select
						few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts
						Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that
						night in 1979), in his office last week.
					</p>
					<p>
						“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
						scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he
						tended his radio telescopes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the
						most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983,
						was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo,
						a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,
						<a href="#">knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</a>
						to tell him the news.

					<p>
						Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered
						anything.
					</p>
					<p>
						“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a
						delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot
						that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
					</p>
					<p>
						Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was
						still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling
						a vacation,” he said.
					</p>
					<p>
						By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had
						been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of
						jubilation and caution.
					</p>
					<p>
						Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if
						this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the
						history of science.”
					</p>
					<p>
						John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head
						of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself
						deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,”
						he said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that
						posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that
						if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed
						reservations about inflation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for
						confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based
						on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s
						Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
					</p>
					<p>
						“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report
						its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar
						measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

						Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic
						microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson
						at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He
						is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly
						sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates
						ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of
						Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of
						Stanford.
					</p>
					<p>
						“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,”
						Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve
						been hooked ever since,” he said.

						In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation
						was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in
						one direction rather than another.
					</p>
					<p>
						This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves
						from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it
						in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves,
						theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little
						arrows going in spirals.
					</p>
					<p>
						Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in
						the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically
						a giant superconducting thermometer.
					</p>
					<p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
					<p>
						The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year
						burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right
						and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.

				<section id="special-time">
					<h2><strong>A Special Time</strong></h2>
					<p>
						The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth,
						staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special
						break point in the evolution of the universe.
					</p>
					<p>
						Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
						electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long
						suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified
						force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
					</p>
					<p>
						As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace,
						like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other.
						The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
					</p>
					<p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
					<p>
						Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature
						falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly
						freeze, releasing latent heat.
					</p>
					<p>
						Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long.
						In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of
						antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself
						supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed
						apart.
					</p>
					<p>
						What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion
						fold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a
						grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
					</p>
					<p>
						Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and
						radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s
						observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across.
						“It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say,
						“but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr.
						Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is
						eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable
						homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up,
						spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the
						multiverse.
					</p>
					<p>
						So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not
						bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
					</p>
					<p>
						We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
						beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it.
						All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept
						away, forever out of our view.
					</p>
					<p>
						“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
						Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you
						wind up at inflation.”
